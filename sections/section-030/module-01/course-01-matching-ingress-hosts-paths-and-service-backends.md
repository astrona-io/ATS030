# Matching Ingress Hosts, Paths And Service Backends

An Ingress declares rules for routing external HTTP or HTTPS traffic to Services. HTTP means Hypertext Transfer Protocol; HTTPS is HTTP protected through Transport Layer Security (TLS). An Ingress controller interprets the resource and configures the actual traffic-handling infrastructure. Creating the resource without a suitable controller does not create a working external entry point.

## Identify The Controller Contract

An IngressClass identifies how an Ingress should be handled under the relevant configuration. The Ingress can select a class explicitly, while cluster defaults and controller behavior determine what happens when it does not. A controller listening for another class may ignore an otherwise valid resource.

Controller-specific annotations can affect behavior, but they are not universal Ingress semantics. A path rewrite supported by one controller cannot be assumed to work on every implementation. Begin with the standard host, path and backend model before relying on implementation extensions.

The controller itself also needs a reachable entry point, such as a provisioned load balancer or another appropriate network arrangement. An address in an Ingress status field is useful evidence, but it does not by itself prove that Domain Name System (DNS), client routing and application configuration all align.

## Follow Host And Path Selection

A host rule matches the request's host according to Ingress semantics. Sending a request to the controller address with an unrelated host can miss the intended rule. DNS maps the application's hostname to an entry address, while host routing selects which declared rule should handle the request. These are separate operations.

An `Exact` path type matches the declared path exactly. A `Prefix` path type matches using path elements rather than arbitrary text-prefix matching. For example, a prefix `/reports` can cover `/reports/daily` without necessarily matching `/reports-old` as the same path element. `ImplementationSpecific` delegates interpretation to the selected implementation.

Where several paths match, the supported precedence rules select the appropriate route, including preference for a longer match and exact matching at otherwise equivalent paths. A default backend can handle requests that do not match declared rules when configured. A default response from the controller is therefore different from an error emitted by the intended application backend.

## Resolve The Backend Port Relationship

A standard backend identifies a Service in the Ingress's namespace and a Service port by number or name. That reference is to the Service port, not directly to an arbitrary container port. The Service's own `targetPort` then maps the request toward its selected Pod endpoints.

Suppose the Service exposes port 80 and forwards to container port 8080. The Ingress backend references Service port 80, while the application must listen at the backend target. Pointing the Ingress to 8080 merely because the container uses that port can be incorrect if the Service exposes no such port.

The Service selector and endpoint readiness remain essential. A route can match the right host and path but still have no eligible backend. Ingress matching, Service selection, target-port mapping and application listening form a chain of independent relationships.

## TLS And Application Assumptions

A TLS configuration can reference a Secret containing certificate and key material in the expected namespace. The requested hostname should be covered by the certificate. A certificate for another name can fail client verification even when HTTP routing rules are otherwise correct.

TLS termination at the controller does not automatically mean the controller-to-backend connection is encrypted. That depends on the controller and backend configuration. Likewise, standard path matching does not universally rewrite the path passed to the application. A backend expecting `/` can return an error when it receives `/reports` unless the application or supported routing configuration handles that path.

The useful design exercise is to trace one request from hostname resolution through class selection, host and path matching, Service port selection and the ready backend. At each point, identify the declared rule and the responsible component. That sequence supports both a correct definition and a focused diagnosis.

## Common pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> An Ingress needs a matching controller and a reachable entry point. Match the Service's exposed port, distinguish prefix path elements from arbitrary string prefixes, and do not assume that path rewriting or backend encryption happens automatically.
