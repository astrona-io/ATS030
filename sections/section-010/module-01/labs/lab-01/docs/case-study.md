# Starting Environment

The application and client fixtures are healthy. Complete the required change without replacing unrelated resources.

Create NetworkPolicy `probe-shuttle` selecting `app: probe` for ingress. Allow only same-namespace Pods labelled `app: shuttle` on TCP port 8080. Keep the original workload and clients healthy. Shuttle must receive version one through the Service; drifter in `outpost` must time out. Do not create any policy that also allows drifter.
