# Pod Addresses And Network Implementation

The `shuttle` Pod sends a request to the `probe` Pod on another node. Kubernetes gives Pods network identities so applications can communicate without needing to know which node hosts each process. Containers inside a normal Pod share its network namespace and can communicate through the local loopback address.

The Kubernetes network model expects Pod-to-Pod communication across nodes without an application needing to translate its Pod address. The network implementation makes that model work through routing, encapsulation or other mechanisms. The details depend on the plugin, infrastructure and configured policy.

The Container Network Interface (CNI) defines an interface used to configure container networking. A CNI plugin helps connect Pod network namespaces and allocate addresses. A network implementation may also enforce policy or implement Service forwarding, but these capabilities are not guaranteed merely because a plugin supports CNI.

A Pod's address is different from a node address. Replacement can give an application a new Pod address. Applications therefore should not treat one Pod address as a permanent service location. A Service supplies a stable access abstraction for selected backends while individual Pods change.

Cross-node communication depends on the configured network implementation, not on the scheduler forwarding packets.

Connectivity also depends on policy and application listeners. Successful Pod placement does not prove that its port is open or its address is reachable from a particular source. For a communication failure, distinguish addressing, route implementation, traffic policy and the process listening on the destination.

## Addressing Across Node Boundaries

Consider `shuttle` on node A and `probe` on node B. The client process sends a packet using its Pod network namespace. The configured network implementation moves that packet across the required host and infrastructure boundaries, then delivers it to the destination Pod network namespace. The application does not ask the scheduler to relay each packet.

An implementation can route directly between Pod address ranges or encapsulate traffic for transport across the underlying network. Encapsulation wraps the original packet in another packet; routing determines how the destination is reached through the network. The choice affects operational details and overhead, but the application-facing goal remains compatible Pod communication.

Infrastructure still matters. Host routing, firewall rules, address allocation and permitted packet sizes can affect whether the plugin's design works. A valid Pod address is not proof that every node path is healthy. A failure limited to cross-node traffic suggests a different boundary from a failure between two containers sharing one Pod.

## Pod Networking And Service Networking

A Pod address identifies an instance. A Service address identifies a stable access abstraction that can direct clients to several instances. The forwarding component must translate or otherwise implement that access pattern according to its design. A network plugin may provide both Pod connectivity and Service behavior, but the responsibilities remain conceptually distinct.

Replacement can change a Pod address while the Service address stays the same. This helps clients avoid tracking every lifecycle event. Long-lived connections can still point to a failed backend, so applications need appropriate reconnection and safe retries. Stable discovery does not make every established connection immortal.

When explaining a failure, identify whether the client uses an instance address or a Service abstraction, whether the path crosses nodes and which component implements that path. Then consider traffic policy and the listener. These details turn a broad “networking is broken” symptom into a bounded question.

## Common pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> Supporting CNI does not guarantee NetworkPolicy enforcement. Pod addresses can change, and the scheduler does not implement packet forwarding.
